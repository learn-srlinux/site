## Project Bond

--8<-- "docs/ndk/guide/dev/go/index.md:bond-intro"

We have created a tutorial demonstrating how to use Bond to develop a simple [NDK Greeter](../guide/dev/go/with-bond/index.md) application in Go.
Developing NDK agents is much simpler with the help of the [Bond][bond-repo] package and we recommend new users to start with it.

## Disabled NDK caching

Starting with SR Linux 24.10.1 caching will be disabled by default for all NDK services except Network instance, Appid, and Config. This is done to ensure high performance of the NDK server while keeping the memory consumption low.

A user can enable caching by registering the agent with the `enable_cache` registration option against the NDK manager server.  With disabled caching, the services will have to use `CreateOrUpdate` SDK Manager Operation, instead of a separate `Create` and `Update` operations.

## Auto Telemetry State

The [`auto_telemetry_state`][ats-proto] field has been added to the `AgentRegistrationRequest` message to instruct the NDK server to automatically mirror the NDK app's configuration to the state database.

When this field is set to `true`, the application will no longer need to set the its configuration to state manually via Telemetry service. This can be useful for applications that do not manage their own state and only need to have configuration values. For such apps, it is no longer needed to update the state manually as it will be done automatically by the NDK server.
